// Convert a Number to a String
// In the previous two exercises, you developed functions that convert simple numeric strings to signed integers. In this exercise and the next, you're going to reverse those functions.

// You will learn more about converting strings to numbers by writing a function that takes a positive integer or zero, and converts it to a string representation.

// You may not use any of the standard conversion functions available in JavaScript, such as String(), Number.prototype.toString, or an expression such as '' + number. Your function should do this the old-fashioned way and construct the string by analyzing and manipulating the number.

// Examples:

console.log(integerToString(4321));      // "4321"
console.log(integerToString(0));         // "0"
console.log(integerToString(5000));      // "5000"
